        <b>(say your intention(s) here...)</b>
       <p><b>Introductory Prayer – To Be Recited Everyday</b> </p>
        Come to me as Father and Friend, Jesus, and do not leave me alone; Lord, abide with me! <br>
        I am just a pilgrim wandering in a world enveloped by darkness; bestow on me your light and
        your grace. Lord, abide with me!<br>
        In this precious moment embrace me; let this union between us last forever. Lord, abide with
        me!<br>
        Accompany me along life’s journey; I need your presence. Without you I become faint and fall.
        Lord, abide with me!<br>
        Evening is coming and I am racing like a river towards the deep sea of death. Lord, abide with
        me!<br>
        Be my strength in sorrow and happiness, whilst I live and until I die within your embrace. Lord,
        abide with me<br>

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">First Day</h4>
        <br>
        <i>“It is to your advantage to commit yourself to the sufferings that Jesus will send to you. Jesus
            cannot tolerate seeing you afflicted and he will come to you and comfort you, blessing you with
            many graces for your soul”... Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Beloved St. Pio of Pietrelcina you have had the signs of the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ
            on your body. You have carried these stigmata for everyone enduring both the physical and
            mental sufferings that racked your soul and body in a continual sacrifice. We beg you to pray for
            us so that we will be able to accept both the little and the larger crosses we too must bear
            enduring our life on earth and to offer these sufferings to God assuring us a place with him in
            Eternal Life.

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Second Day</h4>
        <br>
        <i>“Have courage and do not fear the assaults of the Devil. Remember this forever; it is a healthy
            sign if the devil shouts and roars around your conscience, since this shows that he is not
            inside your will”. Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, together with Our Lord Jesus Christ, you’ve been able to withstand the
            temptations of the Devil. You suffered the beatings and the oppression of the demon of hell,
            who wanted to have you abandon your journey of holiness. We beg you to pray for us so that,
            with your help and the help of all of the Heavenly Kingdom, we will be able to find the strength to
            set sin aside and to persevere in our faith until the day of our death.

        <br>
        <i>“Mary has to be the star that illuminates your path and she will show you the secure way to go
            to the Celestial Father. She will be an anchor to which you must cling in the hour of
            temptation”. Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Virtuous St. Pio of Pietrelcina, you love Our Holy Mother very much and have received daily
            graces and consolations from her. Please, we beg you to pray to the Holy Mother for us.
            Place in her hands the sorrow for our sins and our prayers of reparation, so that, as at Cana of
            Galilee, her Son says ‘yes’ to His Mother and our name may be written in the Book of Eternal
            Life.

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Fourth Day</h4>
        <br>
        <i>“Invoke your Guardian Angel, who will enlighten you and guide you. God has given him to
            you for your protection, therefore, you should use him accordingly”. Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Chaste St. Pio of Pietrelcina, you loved your Guardian Angel, who served you well as your
            guide and as a defender and messenger. The Angels brought the prayers of your spiritual
            children to you. We beg you to pray for us, so that we may learn to call on our Guardian Angel
            who is always ready to guide us to what is good and to avoid falling into sinful actions.

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Fifth Day</h4>
        <br>
        <i>“My God, I beg you; let me bear the punishments that have been prepared for sinners and the
            souls in Purgatory. Multiply these punishments for me, so that you may forgive and save the
            sinners and free their souls from purgatory”. Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Prudent St. Pio of Pietrelcina, you have had a great devotion for the Souls in Purgatory for
            whom you have offered yourself as a victim to remit their punishments. Please pray for us and
            ask God to send us the same interest, compassion and love that you have for these souls. In
            this way, we will also contribute to reducing their suffering and, with our sacrifices and prayers,
            win for them their necessary Indulgences.

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Sixth Day</h4>
        <br>
        <i>“If I knew that a person was afflicted in his mind, body or soul, I would beg God to set him
            free of his affliction. I would gladly accept the transfer of his affliction to myself, so that he
            may be saved, and I would ask that he benefit from the fruits of these sufferings... if the Lord
            would allow me to do it”. Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Obedient St. Pio of Pietrelcina, you have loved the sick more than yourself, because you
            were able to see Jesus in them. You have performed many miracles by healing patients in
            the name of Jesus and thereby giving them peace of mind. We beg you to pray for us, so that
            sick patients, through the intercession of Mary, can be healed and their bodies restored so
            that they may benefit from the Holy Spirit and, therefore, thank and praise God forever.

        <br>
        <i>“ If the people of the World could only see the beauty of one’s soul when it is in the grace of
            God, all sinners and non-believers of this world would be instantly Converted” Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Blessed St. Pio of Pietrelcina, you have worked in “God’s Plan for Salvation”, by offering your
            sufferings to free sinners from the chains of the Devil. We beg you to pray for us, so that
            unbelievers will be converted to the faith, that all sinners will repent in their hearts and that
            those with lukewarm hearts will find renewed enthusiasm for a Christian life. Finally, pray for
            all those who are faithful, so that they will persevere on their way to salvation.

        <br>
        <i>“It would be most fulfilling, if God would grant me just one wish (if it were possible); that He
            would say, “Enter Heaven!” This is my one true wish; “That God would take me to Heaven at
            the same time that the last of my children and the last of the people who submitted to my
            priestly care have entered”. Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Pure St. Pio of Pietrelcina, you experienced great love for your spiritual children and have
            helped them by purchasing them for Christ with the giving of your blood. Please grant us,
            who have not met you personally, the opportunity to be considered your spiritual children. In
            this way, with your protection, guidance and strength, you will obtain for us a special blessing
            from God, so that we may meet Him on the day of our death at the gates of Heaven.

        <br>
        <i>“You must always keep yourself on the straight and narrow path in the Holy Catholic Church
            because She is the only Bride of Christ and can bring you peace. She alone possesses
            Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, who is the true Prince of Peace”. Padre Pio</i>
        <p>Humble St. Pio of Pietrelcina, you who loved the Roman Catholic Church, pray for us. May
            the Master send workers to the harvest and give them the strength and knowledge needed to
            be children of God. Pray that Our Holy Lady will unite Christian people everywhere,
            comforting all of them in one great house of the Lord, the lighthouse of our salvation in the
            storm of life... just as a lighthouse is a beacon for safe return when there is a storm at sea.
