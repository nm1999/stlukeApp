<h1 id="more-about-st-jude">More About St. Jude </a></h1>
<p>St. Jude Thaddeus was one of the 12 Apostles of Christ. (Note that he should not be confused with the traitor Judas Iscariot.)</p>
<p>St. Jude is called the “brother of Jesus” in Matthew 13:55 and Mark 6:3, but we know from Catholic Tradition that this usage means a relative of Jesus, potentially a cousin, as his mother was Clopas, the Virgin Mary’s cousin.</p>
<p>St. Jude is also called “the brother of James,” indicating St. James the Less, and Tradition indicates St. Jude was the author of the Epistle of Jude in the New Testament.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols of St. Jude</strong></p>
<p>St. Jude is often depicted with a club, since some sources say he was martyred by being beaten to death with a club.</p>
<p>He is also often shown with a flame over his head, a reference to his presence in the Upper Room at Pentecost, with the Virgin Mary and the other Apostles, where they received the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In paintings, St. Jude is shown holding an image of Christ, called the Image of Edessa.</p>
<p>The legend goes that King Abgar of Edessa asked Jesus to cure him of an illness. Jesus responded by making an impression of his face onto a cloth and sent it back to Abgar through his envoy. After Christ’s crucifixion, St. Jude sent another disciple to King Abgar and immediately Abgar was healed. The king and his kingdom converted to Christianity.</p>
<p><strong>The Martyrdom of St. Jude</strong></p>
<p>After his death, St. Jude’s body was placed in a crypt in St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, many people have prayed for his intercession and received help, leading to his designation as the patron saint for hopeless causes. Both St. Bridget of Sweden and St. Bernard were given private revelation that St. Jude was the patron saint of the impossible.</p>
<p>According to one tradition, Saint Jude was martyred in 65 AD in Beirut along with the Simon the Zealot (also an Apostle), executed either by an axe or club.</p>

<p><strong>Do We Need St. Jude’s Prayers?</strong></p>
<p>When I first became Catholic, I was skeptical of asking saints to pray for me, a hold over from the biases of my Protestant days.</p>
    <p>But as I grew in my faith, I realized that not only can we ask the saints, like St. Jude, to pray for us, but that it is the best thing that we can do!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
