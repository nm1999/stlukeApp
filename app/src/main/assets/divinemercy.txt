        <h3 style="text-align:center;">9 DAY DIVINE MERCY NOVENA</h3>
    <h4>First Day</h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me all mankind, especially
        all sinners, and immerse them in the ocean of my
        mercy. In this way you will console me in the bitter
        grief into which the loss of souls plunges me."</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most merciful Jesus, whose very nature it is to have
        compassion on us to forgive us, do not look upon our
        sins, but upon our trust which we place in Your
        infinite goodness. Receive us all into the abode of
        Your Most Compassionate Heart, and never let us
        escape from it. We beg this of You by Your love
        which unites You to the Father and the Holy Spirit.
        Eternal Father, turn Your Merciful gaze upon all
        mankind and especially upon poor sinners, all enfolded
        in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. For the sake of His Sorrowful Passion show us
        Your Mercy, that we may praise the infinite power of Your Mercy, forever and forever.
        Amen."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
    <h4>Second Day</h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me the souls of Priests and Religious and immerse them in my
        unfathomable mercy. It was they who gave me strength to endure my bitter passion.
        Through them, as though channels, my mercy flows out upon mankind."</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Merciful Jesus, from whom comes all that is good, increase Your grace in men and
        women consecrated to Your service that they perform worthy works of mercy, and that all
        who see them may glorify the Father of Mercy who is in Heaven. Eternal Father, turn Your
        merciful gaze upon the company of chosen ones in Your vineyard - upon the souls of
        Priests and Religious - and endow them with the strength of Your Blessing. For the Love of
        the Heart of Your Son in which they are enfolded, impart to them Your Power and Light,
        that they may be able to guide others in the way of salvation, and with one voice sing
        praise to Your boundless Mercy for ages without end. Amen
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
    <h4>Third Day</h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me all devout and faithful souls and immerse them in the ocean
        of my mercy. These souls brought me consolation on the Way of the Cross. They were that
        drop of consolation in the midst of an ocean of bitterness."</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Merciful Jesus, from the treasury of Your Mercy, You impart Your graces in great
        abundance to each and all. Receive us into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart
        and never let us escape from it. We beg this grace of You by that most wondrous love for
        the heavenly Father with which Your Heart burns so fiercely. Eternal Father, turn Your
        merciful gaze upon faithful souls, as upon the inheritance of Your Son. For the sake of His
        Sorrowful Passion grant them Your blessing and surround them with Your constant
        protection. Thus may they never fail in love or lose the treasure of the Holy Faith, but
        rather, with all the hosts of Angels and Saints, may they glorify Your boundless Mercy for
        endless ages. Amen
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
    <h4>Fourth Day</h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me those who do not believe in God and those who do not yet
        know me. I was thinking also of them during my bitter passion, and their future zeal
        comforted my heart. Immerse them in the ocean of my mercy."</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Compassionate Jesus, You are the Light of the whole world. Receive into the abode
        of Your Most Compassionate Heart the souls of those who as yet do not believe in You or
        do not know You. Let the rays of Your Grace enlighten them that they, too, together with
        us, may extol Your wonderful Mercy, and do not let them escape from the abode which is
        Your Compassionate Heart. Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the souls who do
        not believe in Your Son, and of those who as yet do not know You, but who are enclosed
        in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. Draw them to the light of the Gospel. These
        souls do not know what great happiness it is to love You. Grant that they, too, may extol
        the generosity of Your Mercy for endless ages. Amen
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
    <h4>Fifth Day </h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me the souls who have separated from my Church and immerse
        them in the ocean of my mercy. During my bitter passion they tore at my body and Heart,
        that is, my Church. As they return to unity with the Church, my wounds heal, and in this
        way they alleviate my passion."</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Merciful Jesus, Goodness Itself, You do not refuse light to those who seek it of You.
        Receive into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart the souls of those who have
        separated from Your Church. Draw them by Your Light into the unity of the Church, and
        do not let them escape from the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart; but bring it
        about that they, too, come to glorify the generosity of Your Mercy. Eternal Father, turn
        3
        Your Merciful gaze upon the souls of those who are separated from Your Son's Church,
        especially those who have squandered Your Blessings and misused Your Graces by
        obstinately persisting in their errors. Do not look upon their errors, but upon the love of
        Your Own Son and upon His Bitter Passion, which He underwent for their sake, since they,
        too, are enclosed in His Most Compassionate Heart. Bring it about that they may glorify
        Your great Mercy for endless ages. Amen
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
    <h4>Sixth Day </h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me the meek and humble souls and the souls of little children
        and immerse them in my mercy. These souls most closely resemble my Heart. They
        strengthened me during my bitter agony. I saw them as earthly angels, who will keep vigil
        at my altars. I pour out upon them whole torrents of grace. Only the humble souls are
        capable of receiving my grace. I favour humble souls with my confidence."</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Merciful Jesus, You Yourself have said "Learn from Me for I am meek and humble of
        heart". Receive into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart all meek and humble
        souls and the souls of little children. These souls send all Heaven into ecstasy, and they are
        the Heavenly Father's favourites. They are a sweet-smelling bouquet before the Throne of
        God; God Himself takes delight in their fragrance. These souls have a permanent abode in
        Your Most Compassionate Heart, O Jesus, and they unceasingly sing out a hymn of love
        and mercy. Eternal Father, turn Your Merciful gaze upon meek and humble souls and upon
        the souls of little children, who are enfolded in the abode which is the Most Compassionate
        Heart of Jesus. These souls bear the closest resemblance to Your Son. Their fragrance rises
        from the earth and reaches Your very Throne. Father of Mercy and of all Goodness, I beg
        You by the love You bear these souls and by the delight You take in them. Bless the whole
        world, that all souls together may sing out the praises of Your Mercy for endless ages.
        Amen
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="">
    <h4>Seventh Day </h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me the souls who especially venerate and glorify my mercy and
        immerse them in my mercy. These souls sorrowed most over my passion and entered most
        deeply into my spirit. They are living images of my compassionate heart. These souls will
        shine with a special brightness in the next life. Not one of them will go into the fire of hell.
        I shall particularly defend each one of them at the hour of death."
        </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Merciful Jesus, whose Heart is Love Itself, receive into the abode of Your Most
        Compassionate Heart the souls of those who particularly extol and venerate the greatness of
        Your Mercy. These souls are mighty with the very power of God Himself. In the midst of
        all afflictions and adversities they go forward confident of Your Mercy. These souls are
        united to Jesus and carry all mankind on their shoulders. These souls will not be judged
        severely, but Your Mercy will embrace them as they depart from this life. Eternal Father,
        turn Your merciful gaze upon the souls who glorify and venerate Your greatest attribute,
        4
        that of Your fathomless Mercy, and who are enclosed in the Most Compassionate Heart of
        Jesus. These souls are a living Gospel; their hands are full of deeds of mercy and their
        spirits, overflowing with joy, sing a canticle of mercy to You, O Most High! I beg You O
        God: show them Your Mercy according to the hope and trust they have placed in You. Let
        there be accomplished in them the Promise of Jesus, who said to them that during their
        life, but especially at the hour of death, the souls who will venerate this fathomless Mercy
        of His, He, Himself, will defend as His Glory. Amen
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="">
    <h4>Eighth Day </h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me the souls who are detained in purgatory and immerse them
        in the abyss of my mercy. Let the torrents of my Blood cool down their scorching flames.
        All these souls are really loved by me. They are making retribution to my justice. It is in
        your power to bring them relief. Draw all indulgences from the treasury of my Church and
        offer them on their behalf. Oh, if you only knew the torments they suffer, you would
        continually offer for them the alms of the spirit and pay off their debt for my justice."

        </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Merciful Jesus, You Yourself have said that You desire mercy; so I bring into the
        abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart the souls in Purgatory, souls who are very dear
        to You, and yet who must make retribution to Your Justice. May the streams of Blood and
        Water which gushed forth from Your Heart put out the flames of the purifying fire, that in
        that place, too, the Power of Your Mercy may be praised. Eternal Father, turn Your
        Merciful gaze upon the souls suffering in Purgatory, who are enfolded in the Most
        Compassionate Heart of Jesus. I beg You, by the sorrowful Passion of Jesus Your Son, and
        by all the bitterness with which His most Sacred Soul was flooded, manifest Your Mercy to
        the souls who are under Your Just Scrutiny. Look upon them in no other way than through
        the Wounds of Jesus, Your Dearly Beloved Son; for we firmly believe that there is no limit
        to Your Goodness and Compassion. Amen
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="">
    <h4>Ninth Day</h4>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;text-align: justify;">Jesus said: "Today bring to me souls who have become lukewarm and immerse them in the
        abyss of my mercy. These souls wound my Heart most painfully. My soul suffered the most
        dreadful loathing in the Garden of Olives because of lukewarm souls. They were the reason
        I cried out: "Father, take this cup away from me, if it be Your will". For them the last hope
        of salvation is to run to my mercy."
        </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most Compassionate Jesus, You are Compassion Itself. I bring lukewarm souls into the
        abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart. In this fire of Your Pure Love let these tepid
        souls, who, like corpses, filled You with such deep loathing, be once again set aflame. O
        Most Compassionate Jesus, exercise the omnipotence of Your Mercy and draw them into
        the very ardour of Your Love; and bestow upon them the gift of Holy Love, for nothing is
        beyond Your power. Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon lukewarm souls who are
        nonetheless enfolded in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. Father of Mercy, I beg
        5
        You by the bitter passion of Your Son and by His three-hour agony on the Cross, let them
        too, glorify the Abyss of Your Mercy. Amen
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>When you go to confession, to this fountain of mercy, the Blood and Water which came
        forth from My Heart always flow down upon your soul...In the Tribunal of Mercy [the
        sacrament of Reconciliation]...the greatest miracles take place and are incessantly
        repeated...Here the misery of the soul meets the God of Mercy..
        Come with faith to the feet of My representative...I myself am waiting there for you. I am
        only hidden by the priest... I Myself act in your soul... Make your confession before Me.
        The person of the priest is, for Me, only a screen. Never analyze what sort of a priest it is
        that I am making use of; open your soul in confession as you would to Me, and I will fill it
        with My light...
        Were a soul like a decaying corpse, so that from a human standpoint, there would be no
        hope of restoration and everything would already be lost, it is not so with God. The
        miracle of Divine Mercy restores that soul in full... From this fount of mercy souls draw
        graces solely worth the vessel of trust. If their trust is great, there is no limit to My
        generosity.
        Our Lord has made the reception of the Eucharist and Reconciliation necessary for
        obtaining His promise of complete forgiveness of sins and punishment for those observing
        the Feast of Mercy. And Pope John Paul II, who has repeatedly stressed the importance of
        God's message of mercy, has exhorted us that, "The Church of the new Advent...must be
        the Church of the Eucharist and of Penance" (Redemptor Hominis).</p>





        <h4>Prayer of consecration to the Divine Mercy</h4>
        <p>Jesus, the Divine Mercy, I consecrate my entire life,
            from this day on, to You without reserve
            Into Your hands I abandon my past, my present and my future
            from this day forward, make me a true follower of Your teaching
            Let Your Divine Mercy Image, protect my home
            and my family from all the powers of evil in this world today.
            May all who venerate it never perish,
            may it be their joy in life, their hope in death,
            and their glory in eternity. Amen.</p>


            <h4>Prayer to Divine Mercy for the unborn</h4>
            <p>For all helpless, little children who die in the womb of their mother, I pray that all of these
                little souls will be given eternal life by Our Lord, Jesus Christ, through his Divine Mercy
                and I beg Jesus that He shows His Mercy also to the parents of these children, especially to
                the mothers, who don't know what they are doing. Lord, enlighten them and give them a
                6
                deeper understanding of the value and beauty of life. May Your Divine Mercy forgive them
                all the hurt they have caused and show them the way of eternal life. Amen</p>

        <h6>Opening Prayer</h6>
        <p>You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed for souls, and

                Will, which is Love and Mercy itself</i>
