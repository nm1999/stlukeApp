  <h2>PRAYER TO ST. PHILOMENA</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        O faithful virgin and glorious martyr, Saint Philomena, who 
        works so many miracles on behalf of the poor and sorrowing, 
        have pity on me. Thou knowest the multitude and diversity of 
        my needs. Behold me at thy feet, full of misery, but full of 
        hope. I entreat thy charity, O great saint! Graciously hear me 
        and obtain from God a favorable answer to the request 
        which I now humbly lay before thee (here specify your 
        petition). I am firmly convinced that through thy merits, 
        through the scorn, the sufferings, the death thou didst 
        endure, united to the merits of the Passion and Death of 
        Jesus, thy Spouse, I shall obtain what I ask of thee, and in the 
        joy of my heart I will bless God, who is admirable in His 
        saints. Amen.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            We beseech Thee, O Lord, to grant us the pardon of our sins 
            by the intercession of Saint Philomena, virgin and martyr, 
            who was always pleasing in Thy sight by her eminent chastity 
            and by the profession of every virtue. Amen.
            Illustrious virgin and martyr, Saint Philomena, behold me 
            prostrate before the throne whereupon it has pleased the 
            Most Holy Trinity to place thee. Full of confidence in thy 
            protection, I entreat thee to intercede for me with God. Ah, 
            from the heights of Heaven deign to cast a glance upon thy 
            humble client! Spouse of Christ, sustain me in suffering 
            fortify me in temptation, protect me in the dangers surrounding me, obtain for me the graces necessary to me, and in 
            particular (here specify your petition). Above all, assist me at 
            the hour of my death. Saint Philomena, powerful with God, 
            pray for us. Amen.
            O God, Most Holy Trinity, we thank Thee for the graces Thou 
            didst bestow upon the Blessed Virgin Mary, and upon Thy 
            handmaid Philomena, through whose intercession we implore 
            Thy Mercy. Amen</p>
