        Gospel (Mt 26:59, 27:13-14, Jn 18:38, Mt 27:20,23,26)
        The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin kept trying to obtain false testimony
        against Jesus in order to put him to death.
        Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against
        you?”
        But he did not answer him one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
        Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”
        The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas but to
        destroy Jesus.
        But he said, “Why? What evil has he done?” They only shouted the louder, “Let him
        be crucified!”
        Then he released Barabbas to them, but after he had Jesus scourged,* he handed him
        over to be crucified. <br>
        <br> <u><b> Contemplation</b></u><br>
        Pilate and Jesus are two very different kinds of men. The man Pilate is a symbol of
        the pride, the wealth and the power of the Roman Empire.
        The man Jesus is the true man, another humanity, a divine humanity.
        When Pilate condemns Jesus he condemns love, he makes the choice we sometimes
        make by refusing to follow a way of life open to God. <br><br>
        <b>L:</b> Let us pray: <br><br>
        <b>A:</b> Father, grant me the grace not to condemn love but to live love and to follow the
        way you show me along the path of your divine humanity.

        Gospel (Mt 27:27-31, Jn 19:17.)
        Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium and gathered the
        whole cohort around him. They stripped off his clothes and threw a scarlet military
        cloak about him. Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head, and a
        reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail,
        King of the Jews!”
        They spat upon him and took the reed and kept striking him on the head. And when
        they had mocked him, they stripped him of the cloak, dressed him in his own clothes,
        and led him off to crucify him.
        And carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in
        Hebrew, Golgotha. <br>
        <br> <u><b>Contemplation</b> </u><br>
        The Cross is something we often see as a burden, something heavy, painful,
        unwanted. Jesus did not come to glorify suffering but by taking up his cross he shows
        us how precious we are in the sight of God. There is no limit to his love for us which
        teaches us that we can turn each cross into a victory of love just like Jesus. <br><br>
        <b>L:</b> Let us pray: <br><br>
        <b>A:</b> Father, help me to accept the cross in my life, whatever it may be- suffering,
        loneliness, bereavement, failure. Give me the grace to know that you are carrying it
        with me, so that it becomes for me a source of new life.

        Prophet (Is 53:2-4.)
        He had no majestic bearing to catch our eye, no beauty to draw us to him. He was
        spurned and avoided by men, a man of suffering, knowing pain, like one from whom
        you turn your face, spurned, and we held him in no esteem. Yet it was our pain that he
        bore, our sufferings he endured. <br>

        Jesus came as a human being sharing all the limitations and weaknesses of human
        nature.
        His falling to the ground reminds us of our weaknesses. His getting up again reminds
        us that only love can enable us to overcome our wrong-doing and help us begin
        again. <br><br>

        A mother meets her Son-both in agony, both in indescribable heartache.
        In this man, Jesus, and in this woman, Mary, there is spoken a “YES” to the Father, a

        love itself. <br><br>
        <b>L:</b> Let us pray: <br><br>

        Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife
        of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there
        whom he loved, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son.” Then he said to

        Cross.
        It is this suffering, this reality that Jesus wished to transform with his love. It is this
        suffering that He calls us also to care for and fill with his love – by giving hope and

        But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his
        legs, but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water
        flowed out. <br>
        <br> <u> <b>Contemplation</b> </u> <br>
        The friends of Jesus acted out of love and they also acted out of haste in order to bury
        Jesus before the Feast of Passover.
        The Jews wanted no reminders of the Cross. But the Cross remains throughout
        history as a sign of God’s love for us.
        Jesus, taken down from the cross, is again in the arms of his mother as he was in the
        stable of Bethlehem and at Nazareth. <br><br>
        <b>L:</b> Let us pray: <br><br>
        <b>A:</b> Father, as we stand beneath the Cross. We desire to venerate the body of your Son
        lying lifeless in the arms of his mother. May we imitate her by accepting a share in
        his cross and by trying to live always in your presence freed from sin and the fear of
        death.
        (Silence)
        <br>
        I love you, Jesus, my love above all things, I repent with my whole heart for having
        offended you. Never let me be separated from you again. Grant that I may love you
        always
        And then do with me whatever you wish.

    <h4 style="text-align:center;">THE FOURTEENTH STATION</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Jesus is laid in the tomb </b><br><br>
        <b>L:</b>We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you
        (All kneel with one knee) <br><br>
        <b>A: </b> : Because by your Holy Cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br>
        Gospel (Jn 19:38-42.)
        After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked
        Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and
        took his body.
        Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture
        of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus
        and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial
        custom.
        Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a
        new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. So they laid Jesus there because of
        the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by. <br>
        <br> <u> <b>Contemplation</b> </u> <br>
        From the moment when man, because of sin, was banished from the tree of life, the
        earth became a burial ground. In one of the innumerable tombs scattered all over the
        continents of this planet of ours, the Son of God, the man Jesus Christ conquered
        death with death.
        Jesus lies in the ground dead, yet now the earth is pregnant with eternal life.<br><br>
        <b>L:</b> Let us pray: <br><br>
        <b>A:</b> Lord of all hopes and freedom, like the grain of wheat, you fell into the ground
        and died to give us life. When all our hopes fail, give us courage. When we feel cut
        off bring us back to the newness of life.
        (Silence)
        <br>
        I love you, Jesus, my love above all things, I repent with my whole heart for having
        offended you. Never let me be separated from you again. Grant that I may love you
        always
        And then do with me whatever you wish.

    <h4 style="text-align:center;">CONCLUDING PRAYER</h4>
    <p>
        <b>L:</b> Now we come to the great conclusion, the tremendous climax of our rescue. On
        the third day, Jesus is risen in His glorious body. This is what gives meaning to all
        that He has done: the action of saving men is now complete. Jesus passed through life
        in the flesh into a new life of oneness with the Father. Now He is seen in all His
        splendor; His disciples have the joy of knowing that He is really God, their Savior,
        the long-awaited One. <br><br>
        <b>A: </b> Jesus, our risen Savior, help us to become a part of Your great redemptive act,
        Your “Passover.” Make us Your travelling companions. Teach us to turn away from
        sin and selfishness and give ourselves wholeheartedly to You. Then we know we will
        reach true happiness. Not that empty bubble the world offers in full-page ads and the
        TV commercials, but the genuine happiness of being with You and the Father and the
        Holy Spirit forever in heaven. Amen.
